# Pento
Pento project from the book [Programming Phoenix LiveView](https://pragprog.com/titles/liveview/programming-phoenix-liveview/) version B12.0

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## You're Wrong!
The Pento app’s first live view is a simple number-guessing game called “You’re Wrong!”
